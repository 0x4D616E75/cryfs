Version 0.8.1
---------------
* Config File Encryption: Configuration files are AES-256-GCM encrypted with a password and the scrypt KDF.
* Password Encryption: If the configuration file is not specified as command line parameter, it will be put into the base directory. The filesystem can be mounted with the password only, without specifying a config file on command line.
* Logfiles: Added a --logfile option to specify where logs should be written to. If the option is not specified, CryFs logs to syslog.
* Running in Background: Fixed daemonization. When CryFs is run without "-f" flag, it will run in background.
